A software engineer from Google will come for a Q and A as well. The workshop curriculum was designed\n          with the active guidance of the CSC 111 and CSC 212 professors. Office hours will be\n          held once weekly.\n          <br /><br />\n          Participants should come into the workshop series comfortable with programming in Python and a willingness to ask questions.

For those of you who want to develop a deeper understanding of sets, relations, and logic, this is a great resource.\n          Other ideas touched on in the book, including proofs and induction (!!!) will show up over and over again in your computer science career. Notably,\n          algorithms, theory of computation, and of course, discrete math will explore these ideas.\n          <br /><br />\n          <h3>A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/bat67/awesome-algorithm-books/blob/master/classic%20algorithms/A%20Common-Sense%20Guide%20to%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20-%20Level%20Up%20Your%20Core%20Programming%20Skills.epub\" alt=\"EPUB of a Common Sense Guide\">\n          A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms</a> is a great guide to data structures for beginners.

For those audiovisual learners out there, I highly recommend his videos.
