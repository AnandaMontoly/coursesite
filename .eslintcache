A software engineer from Google will come for a Q and A as well. The workshop curriculum was designed\n          with the active guidance of the CSC 111 and CSC 212 professors. Office hours will be\n          held once weekly.\n          <br /><br />\n          Participants should come into the workshop series comfortable with programming in Python and a willingness to ask questions.

For those of you who want to develop a deeper understanding of sets, relations, and logic, this is a great resource.\n          Other ideas touched on in the book, including proofs and induction (!!!) will show up over and over again in your computer science career. Notably,\n          algorithms, theory of computation, and of course, discrete math will explore these ideas.\n          <br /><br />\n          <h3>A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/bat67/awesome-algorithm-books/blob/master/classic%20algorithms/A%20Common-Sense%20Guide%20to%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20-%20Level%20Up%20Your%20Core%20Programming%20Skills.epub\" alt=\"EPUB of a Common Sense Guide\">\n          A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms</a> is a great guide to data structures for beginners. It is the most accessible textbook that I've\n          found on the topic from a learning perspective. One note - this file is an epub file instead of a pdf. If you don't already have an epub viewer installed\n          on your computer, you can download the Nook book viewer from Barnes and Noble or the Calibre open source epub reader.

There are activities\n          which let you try out your code, guides to new concepts, and lots and lots of examples. I highly recommend it for those of you who want to try out some Java.\n          <br /><br />\n          <h3>Reducible</h3>\n          <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK8XIGR5kRidIw2fWqwyHRA/videos\" alt=\"Reducible YouTube Channel\">Reducible</a> is a YouTube channel dedicated to talking through data structures and algorithms concepts\n          with clear graphics. For those audiovisual learners out there, I highly recommend his videos. Not all will be relevant to either these workshops or CSC 212 (Dynamic Programming, Fourier Transformations, etc)\n          but the rest are related to material that you will later go over.\n          <h3>CSC 212 Wiki</h3>\n          This <a href=\"https://jjfiv.github.io/ds4j/Sorting2.html\">wiki</a> was written by the CSC 212 professor last year for his class during the transition to virtual classes.
